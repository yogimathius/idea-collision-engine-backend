# Idea Collision Engine 💥

Break out of familiar patterns with unexpected but relevant idea combinations.

## What is this?

The Idea Collision Engine generates intentional cognitive disruptions by combining your interests and projects with unexpected domains like biomimicry, ancient civilizations, quantum physics, or martial arts. It's designed to spark genuinely novel directions when you're stuck in creative ruts.

## Features

- **Smart Collision Generation**: AI-powered connections between your project and unexpected domains
- **Quality-Focused**: Curated collision domains with relevance scoring
- **Exploration Tools**: Spark questions, examples, and actionable next steps
- **History Tracking**: Remember and build on your best collisions
- **Intensity Control**: From gentle connections to radical mind-bending leaps

## How to Use

1. **Enter your interests** (productivity, design, javascript, etc.)
2. **Describe your current project** (what you're working on)
3. **Choose project type** (product, content, business, research)
4. **Select intensity** (gentle, moderate, or radical)
5. **Generate collision** and explore the unexpected connections!

## MVP Status

This is an ultra-minimal MVP focused on validating the core collision concept:

- ✅ Core collision generation with 15 curated domains
- ✅ Template-based connection generation (no OpenAI API yet)
- ✅ Local storage for collision history
- ✅ Rating and notes system
- ✅ Responsive design with smooth animations

## Next Steps (Post-MVP)

- [ ] OpenAI integration for dynamic connection generation
- [ ] User accounts and cloud storage
- [ ] Expanded domain database (200+ domains)
- [ ] Pattern recognition and personalization
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Freemium model implementation

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Build**: Vite
- **Storage**: localStorage (MVP only)
- **Deploy**: Vercel

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Success Metrics (MVP)

- Users generate 3+ collisions per session
- 80%+ find collisions "unexpectedly relevant"
- Users share results or return within 24 hours
- Zero technical barriers to usage
